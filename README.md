# Deep-Learning
This is a Tensorflow build on a Pyhon language base to select an image from any file and classify the objects present in them with their accuracy percentage.
Still in development. Only the GUI has been built till now. Stay tuned for future updates.
Will add radio buttons in GUI for human feedback. 
Will love to hear from you guys for new ideas that can be incorporated in the GUI. Mail me using my primary mail id
